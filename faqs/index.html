        <div class='question'>
          <p>What are the current occupancy limit laws?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>The occupancy limit is <strong>3</strong> for most rental homes, though some allow 4. It depends on what zone the home is in. It does <strong>not</strong> depend on how many bedrooms the dwelling contains.</p>
          
          <p>You can view <a href="http://gisweb.bouldercolorado.gov/agswebsites/pds/pds_zoning/" target="_blank">this map</a> to find out what zone you&#39;re in.</p>
          
          <p>Most rental properties are in zones <strong>RR</strong>, <strong>RE</strong>, <strong>RL</strong>, which forbid more than 3 unrelated people from living together (same for zones <strong>P</strong> and <strong>A</strong>). For rental properties in other zones of the city, the occupancy limit is 4.</p>
          
          <p>These laws are defined in the <a href="https://www2.municode.com/library/co/boulder/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT9LAUSCO_CH8INST_9-8-5OCDWUN" target="_blank">Boulder Revised Code, Title 9, Chapter 8, Section 5, Subsection a</a>, if you&#39;d like to read them yourself.</p>

      <div class='q-and-a'>
        <div class='question'>
          <p>Why are you interested in permitting higher occupancy?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Families can occupy their homes themselves in any way they choose. However, with the current occupancy limits, renters and homeowners renting parts of their homes do not have that freedom. Renters and these homeowners represent a diverse demographic, and they do not always have the right to occupy a home with the people they choose, be it friends, partner(s) or their support system. Our goal with this initiative is to allow all people the right to choose who they live with. We believe that people are equal, regardless of their family status.</p>

        <div class='question'>
          <p>What are the expected benefits from allowing more people to live together in one home?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Increasing the housing capacity would immediately relieve stress on the housing supply and the housing market. As a result, there will be more housing and it will be more affordable. This will occur without any construction or changes to neighborhoods. In addition, this allows non-families to live together, opening up properties for those looking for single family homes.</p>
          
          <p>In addition, more people living in one dwelling is more efficient. More people could afford to live in the City of Boulder, which would result in less emissions from commuting. Therefore, allowing at least one person for every bedroom in a dwelling is <strong>greener</strong>, both on the household level and on the city level.</p>
          
          <p>Allowing more people to legally live together will also make it easier for people to start their lives in Boulder and stay in Boulder. Currently Boulder has a steadily increasing in-commuter population. Many of these people, according to the <a href="https://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/BBC_-_Housing_Choice_Survey_and_Analysis-1-201405131151.pdf" target="_blank">2014 Boulder Housing Choice Survey and Analysis</a>, left Boulder due to insufficient suitable and affordable homes. The majority of these people did not want to leave the City of Boulder. Allowing more people to live together may help these people stay. This will lead to a greater sense of community since now more residents can remain residents and continue to participate in their neighborhoods and the City.</p>

        <div class='question'>
          <p>What are the environmental impacts?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>There are many expected positive environmental impacts from allowing at least one person per bedroom in each home. These positive impacts include having a more efficient household. The energy use per person, in the form of heating, electricity and water, should decrease. In addition, since allowing at least a person for every bedroom in a home will increase the supply of housing, there is the potential for less commuting into the City.</p>

        <div class='question'>
          <p>With more occupants within one home, there may be more cars per household. How will parking be addressed?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Historically, in neighborhoods where parking issues have arisen, neighborhood parking programs have been enacted. We hope that this program extends to any future neighborhoods where parking becomes an issue.</p>

          <p>How will excess noise and trash be addressed?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Excess noise is already addressed in the <a href="https://www2.municode.com/library/co/boulder/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT5GEOF_CH9NO" target="_blank">Boulder Revised Code, Title 5, Chapter 9</a>. Neighbors will still have to abide by these laws, regardless of the number of people in a home.</p>

        <div class='question'>
          <p>How will the increase in the number of people living in one home influence the supply of housing in Boulder?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Allowing more people to live in a home will instantly increase the supply of housing.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='q-and-a'>
        <div class='question'>
          <p>Why do all residential zones have the same proposed occupancy limit increase and not different occupancy limits based on zone, like what is currently in the <a href="https://www2.municode.com/library/co/boulder/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT9LAUSCO_CH8INST_9-8-5OCDWUN" target="_blank">Boulder Revised Code, Title 9, Chapter 8, Section 5, Subsection a</a>?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>We chose to have the same occupancy limit increase for all residential zones in order to allow all homes in Boulder to be able to house the number of people they were designed to house.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='q-and-a'>
        <div class='question'>
          <p>How much would this cost Boulder?</p>
        </div>
        <div class='answer'>
          <p>Increasing the occupancy of homes will cost the City nothing. In fact, it may save Boulder money by increasing the supply of housing without having to build any new structures. Fewer new homes will need to be built if existing homes are used to their full potential. Because of this, allowing an occupant for every bedroom in a home is a free way for the City to combat its inadequate supply of housing.</p>
