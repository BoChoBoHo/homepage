      <h2>Boulder&rsquo;s Housing Crisis</h2>
      
      <p>The median home values for Boulder City and Boulder County have steadily increased over the
      past few years,
      with the Boulder City median home value about 27% higher than the County‚Äôs median home value, as of 2014 (1).
      This increase in home values is an issue that <a href="http://www.bouldercounty.org/doc/hhs/10.27.15%20bcha%20board%20affordable%20housing%20presentation.pdf">Boulder County has addressed</a> as ‚Äúan affordable housing crisis‚Äù and has had many impacts in our community.
      Many members of the Boulder community have been forced to leave the City, and many people
      who have jobs in our City now have to commute into Boulder for work.</p>
      
      <p>graph 1</p>
      
      <h3>Rising Numbers of In-commuters</h3>
      
      <p>Because of the housing crisis,i
      more people are choosing not to live in the City of Boulder even though they work here.
      Based on a survey by the City of Boulder,
      we see that the number of in-commuters have risen steadily since 2010 (3).
      The rise of in-commuters harms our City‚Äôs sustainability goals through the greater use of cars.</p>
      
      <p>graph 2</p>
      
      <p>In another survey conducted by the City of Boulder,
      affordability is the <a href="https://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/BBC_-_Housing_Choice_Survey_and_Analysis-1-201405131151.pdf">most cited reason for why in-commuters</a> chose not to live in Boulder. Other top reasons include the size and quality of the homes available.</p>
      
      <p>graph 3</p>
      
      <p>The majority of in-commuters have previously lived in Boulder.
      Of those who had previously lived in Boulder,
      roughly a third (34%) had to move out of Boulder when they
      <strong>did not want to leave the City</strong> (within the past five years from when the study was conducted).
      The lack of affordable housing
      and the very low residential rental vacancy rates (3.5% in 2014, 5) together reduce the amount of suitable housing in the City of Boulder, forcing people to leave.</p>
      
      <p>graph 4</p>
      
      <h3>Housing Cost-burden</h3>
      
      <p>Another consequence of the housing crisis is the destabilization of the housing market.
      This can be measured by how much of the community is cost-burdened.</p>
      
      <p>Cost-burdened renter: Rent is greater than 30% of monthly income.
      Severely cost-burdened renter: Rent is greater than 50% of monthly income.</p>
      
      <p>The graph below (from another study done by the County of Boulder) shows the percentage of renters in Boulder County,
      grouped by comparison to the Area Median Income (AMI),
      who are either cost-burdened or severely cost-burdened (2).</p>
      
      <p>graph 5</p>
      
      <p>55% of all Boulder County renters are cost-burdened.</p>
      
      <p>31% of all Boulder County renters are severely cost-burdened.</p>
      
      <p>These numbers are a direct result of the lack of affordable housing for low and middle income residents.</p>
      
      <p>Therefore, with our proposed ballot measure,
      we seek to increase the supply of housing.
      By adding more of the existing available units to the housing supply we hope to help keep residents of Boulder in Boulder and bring back previous residents that had to leave because of affordability issues.
      In addition, we hope by adding this option of housing,
      future residents who will work in the City will be able to live here
      and participate in the community where they work.</p>
